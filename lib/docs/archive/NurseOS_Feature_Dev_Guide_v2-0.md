### 🔁 Mock Data Management

- Each core feature (Vitals, Care Plans, Assessments) must have:
  - Sample data defined via `MockScenarioBuilder`
  - Linked UIDs from `mock_constants.dart`
  - Mock services capable of toggling success/failure
- Scenario-first test planning is required before UI integration
