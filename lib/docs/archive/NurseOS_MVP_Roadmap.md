# 🩺 NurseOS – Smart, Streamlined Nursing Workflow at the Point of Care

**NurseOS** is a mobile-first, AI-enhanced care coordination app built specifically for nurses working in concierge, home health, and team-based clinical settings. It eliminates paper clutter, reduces handoff errors, and empowers nurses to document, track, and coordinate care confidently—without relying on bloated hospital systems or complex EMRs.

This MVP is designed for solo nurses and small teams, with mock-first development that minimizes rework when Firebase integration is added. Every feature is optimized for usability, HIPAA awareness, and real-world nursing workflows.

## 👥 Who It Helps

- **Concierge Nurses** managing their own patient panels
- **Home Health Teams** needing fast, secure handoffs and assessments
- **Independent Agencies** wanting a lightweight alternative to WellSky
- **Nurses in Hospitals or LTCs** who need a personal system to organize care plans and notes

---

## 💡 Why It’s Different

- ✅ Built *for nurses first*—not retrofitted from admin systems  
- ✅ Includes **head-to-toe assessments**, care plans, vitals, shift notes, and handoff summaries  
- ✅ Powered by GPT for **HIPAA-compliant documentation support**  
- ✅ Designed with a **mock-first architecture**, so you can test everything locally without Firebase until you’re ready  
- ✅ Ready to evolve into a full ecosystem with admin portals, AI triage, and family-facing summaries—when the time is right  

---

*Clarity. Continuity. Confidence. This is what a nurse-first OS should feel like.*

# ✅ NurseOS MVP-Plus Roadmap (Finalized – June 2025)

## 🎯 MVP Goals
- Empower individual nurses and small teams
- Deliver immediate clinical value with zero bloat
- Use mock/fake data only until the final stages (no Firebase until late)
- Leverage AI only where it saves time and ensures compliance
- Build with a structure that supports easy Firebase and team scaling later

## ⚡ ENHANCEMENT LAYER

### 🌟 Shift Handoff Summary
- Auto-generates from:
  - Most recent vitals
  - Active care plans
  - Recent sentiment-tagged notes
  - Risk flags and visual alerts
  - Most recent head-to-toe assessment

- Auto-suggest fields: concerns, tasks done, follow-ups needed
- Saved in timeline and linkable to shift handoff

### 👥 Assigned Nurse Access Model
- Each patient includes a list of authorized nurse UIDs
- Nurses only see patients where they’re listed
- Supports future multi-nurse and admin dashboard use cases
- `createdBy`, `lastUpdatedBy`, and timestamps tracked

### 📄 Family Summary Export
- Plain-English summary of care plan, vitals, and recent notes
- One-tap “Share Summary” button
- Share via clipboard, print, or email (no messaging yet)

## 🟠 POLISH (Optional if Time Permits)
- Inter font + dark mode
- Profile settings screen
- Quick actions on patient list
- Simple dashboard with today’s patients and handoff status

---

## 🔴 EXCLUDED (For Post-MVP or Phase 2+)
- Messaging (async or real-time)
- Admin dashboards

## ⚙ Mock-First Development Principles
- No Firebase Auth or Firestore until final phase
- All services use fake/mock data structures
- Match Firestore schema and logic now to avoid rework later
- Modular service architecture allows hot-swap with real backend
